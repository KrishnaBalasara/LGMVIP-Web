# <span style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">To Do List Web App</span>

Develop a basic To-Do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.

- The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible.
- Also, a user can mark a task “complete” upon its successful completion
- In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list.
- Irrespective of the list, a user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it.
